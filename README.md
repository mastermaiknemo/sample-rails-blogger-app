# Minimal blogger app


This is a leightweight rails app with some react.js demonstration code and funky code snippets. Be like a rainbow.

just run ->

bundle install

update database.yml to your local machine database (its sqlite3 here)

run ->

rake:db create && rake:migrate

or just rake:db setup

start rails console -> rails c

create some fake data in rails console by running ->

helper.fakeMyData

Feel free to extend and fork the code.

Best regards.
